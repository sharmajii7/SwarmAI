# Spring Boot Project with Register Login functionality as well as a chat app

We have build two main functionalities:

Register user (stored data into MySQL database). 
Login Authentication - validate user login credentials with database email and password. 
We will secure the Registered Users Page with role-based Spring Security.

We also have a chat button in the index.html page itself which when clicked initialises
and redirects users into a group chat where they can see each other's messages due to the
help of a web socket.
